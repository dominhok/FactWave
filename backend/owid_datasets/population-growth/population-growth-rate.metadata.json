      "descriptionProcessing": "### Combination of different sources\nThe data is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:\n\n- 1700 BCE - 1799: Historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3). Growth rate estimated over 50-year periods.\n\n- 1800 - 1949: Historical estimates by Gapminder (v7). Growth rate estimated over 50-year periods until 1900, then 10-year periods.\n\n- 1950-2023: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision). Growth rate estimated over 1-year periods.\n\n- 2024-2100: Projections based on Medium variant by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision). Growth rate estimated over 1-year periods.\n\n### Regional aggregates\n\n**Continents and other region aggregates**:\n\nFor most of the years, we've estimated regional aggregates by summing the population of countries in each region. We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).\n\n**World**:\n- Before 1800: We've used HYDE's estimates.\n- 1800-1950: We've estimated the World population by summing all available countries in the dataset, ensuring that we do not double-count any country.\n- After 1950: We've relied on UN WPP's estimates.",
