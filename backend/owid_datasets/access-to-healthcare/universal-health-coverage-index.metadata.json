The indicator is an index reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, which is computed as the geometric mean of 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage. The tracer indicators are as follows, organized by four components of service coverage: 1\\. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health 2\\. Infectious diseases 3\\. Noncommunicable diseases 4\\. Service capacity and access",
