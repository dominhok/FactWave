# World population growth - Data package

This data package contains the data that powers the chart ["World population growth"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-growth-rate) on the Our World in Data website. It was downloaded on August 07, 2025.

## CSV Structure

The high level structure of the CSV file is that each row is an observation for an entity (usually a country or region) and a timepoint (usually a year).

The first two columns in the CSV file are "Entity" and "Code". "Entity" is the name of the entity (e.g. "United States"). "Code" is the OWID internal entity code that we use if the entity is a country or region. For normal countries, this is the same as the [iso alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) code of the entity (e.g. "USA") - for non-standard countries like historical countries these are custom codes.

The third column is either "Year" or "Day". If the data is annual, this is "Year" and contains only the year as an integer. If the column is "Day", the column contains a date string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

The final column is the data column, which is the time series that powers the chart. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "full data" option, then the column corresponds to the time series below. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "only selected data visible in the chart" option then the data column is transformed depending on the chart type and thus the association with the time series might not be as straightforward.

## Metadata.json structure

The .metadata.json file contains metadata about the data package. The "charts" key contains information to recreate the chart, like the title, subtitle etc.. The "columns" key contains information about each of the columns in the csv, like the unit, timespan covered, citation for the data etc..

## About the data

Our World in Data is almost never the original producer of the data - almost all of the data we use has been compiled by others. If you want to re-use data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to the sources' license and to credit them correctly. Please note that a single time series may have more than one source - e.g. when we stich together data from different time periods by different producers or when we calculate per capita metrics using population data from a second source.

## Detailed information about the data


## Population growth rate
Average exponential rate of growth of the population over a given period. It is calculated as ln(P2/P1) where P1 and P2 are the populations on subsequent years. Available from 1700 to 2100, based on data and estimates from different sources.

#### Notes on our processing step for this indicator
### Combination of different sources
The data is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

- 1700 BCE - 1799: Historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3). Growth rate estimated over 50-year periods.

- 1800 - 1949: Historical estimates by Gapminder (v7). Growth rate estimated over 50-year periods until 1900, then 10-year periods.

- 1950-2023: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision). Growth rate estimated over 1-year periods.

- 2024-2100: Projections based on Medium variant by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision). Growth rate estimated over 1-year periods.

### Regional aggregates

**Continents and other region aggregates**:

For most of the years, we've estimated regional aggregates by summing the population of countries in each region. We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).

**World**:
- Before 1800: We've used HYDE's estimates.
- 1800-1950: We've estimated the World population by summing all available countries in the dataset, ensuring that we do not double-count any country.
- After 1950: We've relied on UN WPP's estimates.
